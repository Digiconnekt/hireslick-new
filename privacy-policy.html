        How do we Process and Protect Personal Information?
      </h2>
      <p>
        We process the personal data we collect, also by automated means, for
        the purposes defined above and for a specific period of time, which
        complies with our internal data retention policy, in order to ensure
        that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary. We maintain
        administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect
        the personal data you provide against accidental, unlawful or
        unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.
      </p>
      <p>
        We and our third party service providers and third party content
        providers, may automatically collect certain information from you
        whenever you access or interact with the Service. This information may
        include, among other information, the browser and operating system you
        are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the Service,
        the search terms you entered into a search engine that led you to the
        Service, areas within the Service that you visited, which links you
        clicked on, which pages or content you viewed and for how long, other
        similar information and statistics about your interactions, such as
        content response times, download errors and length of visits to certain
        pages and other information commonly shared when browsers communicate
        with websites. We may combine this automatically collected log
        information with other information we collect about you. We do this to
        improve services we offer you, and to improve marketing, analytics, and
        site functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like many websites, we and our marketing partners, affiliates,
        analytics, and service providers use “cookies” to collect information. A
        cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard
        disk for record-keeping purposes. We use both persistent cookies that
        remain on your computer and similar device and session ID cookies, which
        expire at the end of your browser. You can control the use of cookies at
        the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it
        may limit your use of certain features or functionality of the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect feedback from Users about their experience with other
        HireSlick Users of our Service. Please note that any feedback you
        provide via the Service or feedback provided about you is publicly
        viewable via the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will cease to retain personal data, as soon as it is reasonable to
        assume that the purpose for collection of such personal data is no
        longer being served by such retention, and such retention is no longer
        necessary for legal or business purposes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="fs-4 mt-5 mb-3">Whom we may share your Personal Data</h2>
      <p>
        We do not disclose personal data that we collect about you, except as
        described in this Privacy policy or in separate notices provided in
        connection with particular activities. We may share personal data with
        our vendors who perform services on our behalf based on our
        instructions, with whom we have individual contractual relationships. We
        do not authorize these vendors to use or disclose the information except
        as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal
        requirements.
      </p>
      <p>In addition, we may disclose personal data about you.</p>
      <p>If we are required to do so by law or legal process.</p>
      <p>
        To law enforcement authorities or other government officials based on a
        lawful disclosure request; and
      </p>
      <p>
        When we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent
        physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation
        of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also reserve the right to transfer personal data we have about you in
        the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets
        (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or
        liquidation). From time to time, we may consider corporate transactions
        such as a merger, acquisition, reorganization, asset sale, or similar.
        In these instances, we may transfer or allow access to information to
        enable the assessment and undertaking of that transaction. If we buy or
        sell any business or assets, personal data may be transferred to third
        parties involved in the transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        We transfer personal data between our group companies and data centers
        and to our clients for the purposes described above. Your personal data
        may be stored in databases located in India. The database is controlled
        by our administrative staff located in India and can be accessed
        electronically.
